# EnverSoft Exercise 2

## Please complete the coding exercise described below. The task itself will be very simple to implement, but we would 
like to see how you would approach the problem as well as how you unit test your code. Feel free to use the libraries 
that you are most comfortable with, but please write the code in C#. When you have completed the task, please upload 
it to the public source repository (GitHub, Bitbucket, Gitlab etc.) 
Provide us with a program that reads a CSV file and outputs two text files. 
The first should show the frequency of the first and last names ordered by frequency descending and then alphabetically 
ascending. 
E.g. 
Smith, 4 
Jones, 3 
Martin, 3 
Brown, 1 
The second should show the addresses sorted alphabetically by street name. 
E.g. 
12 Acton St 
31 Clifton Rd 
22 Jones Rd 
So ordered by frequency first (descending) and then alphabetically (ascending). 
For the list of names: 
Matt Brown 
Heinrich Jones 
Johnson Smith 
Tim Johnson 
The first list should be: 
Johnson, 2 
Brown, 1 
Heinrich, 1 
Jones, 1 
Matt, 1 
Smith, 1 
Tim, 1 
## As mentioned can you also include a unit test project using whichever unit-testing framework you are most comfortable 
withâ€¦
